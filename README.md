Trying my hand at Sequence Alignment using Python

## bioinformatics

**Sequence Alignment in Python**
This project features a simple implementation of sequence alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in Python.

**Description**
This is my first Python project focused on sequence alignment. The implementation aligns two DNA sequences to identify similarities and differences, which can be useful in genetic studies.

**Resources**
The code was developed by consulting various existing resources and literature on bioinformatics and algorithms.

**How to Use**
Clone the repository.
You can just run the script to see the alignment of the provided DNA sequences.
Feel free to modify the sequences for your analysis!

**Acknowledgments**
Thanks to the online programming community and educational resources that guided me through this project.
